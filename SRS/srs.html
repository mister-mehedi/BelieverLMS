      <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Contraints:</h3>
      BELIEVER is developed in Java actually Sprnig Boot to be more specific , it uses OpenCV for facial recognition,
      Api’s voice to text conversion. It uses a modular design where every feature is wrapped into a separate module and
      the modules depend on each other through well-written APIs.


      <p>
        Constraints:
      <ul>
        <li>It needs enough light.</li>
        <li>It needd good quality webcam.</li>
        <li>It needs mic.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h3>2.6 User Documentation:</h3>
      <p>
        User documentation will be available when the software will be ready.
        It will be written maintaining IEEE format.
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies:</h3>
      <p>
        The computer vision features may not be perfect. It depends on the user webcam quality. Also the speech to text
        conversion maybe not that accurate. Exam evaluation can be sometimes inaccurate.

      <h3>3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Since it is a web application any OS with a browser will be enough. Users can access using a web browser and
        also with their android devices. To interact with the database we will be using Spring boot. And we will be
        using MySQL for managing databases. Spring will be used to interact with the centralized server.

      <h3>3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
      <p>This software will communicate with google OAuth API for login verification. It will also communicate with the
        MySql server for the database. For transfering data it will use HTTP communication protocol and it will send
        responses as JSON. It will need continuous internet connectivity . </p>
